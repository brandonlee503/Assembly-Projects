# Assembly-Projects
This repo contains my assembly assignments from CS 271 written in x86 MASM

These programs were written, compiled, and run on Visual Studios 2010. In addition, we use the Irvine32.inc library from our textbook.

### Getting Started

To set up and run these projects, simply cloning the repo and opening the project through Visual Studios via the Project.sln file in each assignment folder should do it!
